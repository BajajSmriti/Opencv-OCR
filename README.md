# OpenCV- OCR project

#### 1. A pdf needs to be provided as an input.
#### 2. It's broken down to images(page-wise).
#### 3. From those images, text is detected.
#### 4. Text detection is done by creating bounding boxes.
#### 5. Coordinates of these BBoxes are stored in a JSON file.

##### In the notebook, it states 'hin.traineddata' is used however, I had changed it to 'san.traineddata'.
##### For better accuracy, one can make use of kernels too.
